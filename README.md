# **Cryptography: Coded Correspondence**

This project is a cryptography exercise where the user interacts with a storyline involving encoded letters exchanged with a fictional pen pal named Vishal. The central task is to implement and solve cryptographic puzzles using Python, primarily focusing on the **Caesar Cipher** method.

### Key Components:
1. **Introduction to Caesar Cipher**:
   - A method where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed offset in the alphabet.
   - Example: Encoding "hello" with an offset of 3 produces "ebiil."

2. **Decoding Encrypted Messages**:
   - Users are tasked with decoding Vishal's encrypted messages by reversing the cipher logic.
   - Example challenge:
     - Encrypted message: `xuo jxuhu! ...`
     - Offset: `10`
     - Solution code reveals the plaintext: `"hey there! this is an example of a caesar cipher..."`

3. **Interactive and Progressive Learning**:
   - Each step builds upon the previous one, teaching concepts like string manipulation, modular arithmetic, and character mapping.
   - Guidance includes hints and suggestions for handling edge cases, such as non-alphabet characters.

### Purpose:
The project blends fun narrative elements with hands-on coding practice, enhancing problem-solving and cryptographic understanding. It serves as an engaging way to apply programming fundamentals to real-world-like puzzles.
